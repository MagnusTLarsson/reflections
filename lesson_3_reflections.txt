When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating, or using multiple platforms, it is an excellent way of accessing common information remotely.
It is also an advantage to keep units under production in the cloud since the storage is (hopefully) more reliable, scalable, 
secure and robust.
