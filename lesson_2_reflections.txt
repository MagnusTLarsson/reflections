What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A "git repository" is created. More or less, some metadata added to the folder (covering that folder and sub directories), which is used by the git system to keep track on files and local history(?). There will be no initial commits, instead, the user needs to "git add" the files which the user desire to track by using git. A git metadata file is created, and visible for inspection if ls -a is used (used to see all files, even those hidden from the users by prepending a '.' infront of the filename).
